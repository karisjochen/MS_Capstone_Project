# MS_Capstone_Project
Imported an Excel file of NCAA 10k and 5k track times from 2010-2019. Cleaned data, feature engineered, and ultimately determined a predictive model

# Process
- source data: TFFRS, coaching salaries to assess model impact
- clean data: indentify duplicates, dirty data, erroneous information 
- subset data: identify data relevant to specific study 
- transform data: create athlete and race specific features to analyze raw data in a new way
- build models: use decision tree regression to help further subset data and recursive feature elimination to identify most significant variabes
- assess model: balance model predictability with model usability
- conclusions: reflect how we can improve current model and/or expand it to other questions.

# Outcome
This was a 5 semester project I completed over time as a Masters student at Texas A&M University. The goal was to build a predictive model using whatever resources or skills we had available. Without knowing any python, I challenged myself to complete this analysis and predicitve model using only python programming and ultimately came out of it with not only a decent model, but more importantly-a whole host of programming skills.
